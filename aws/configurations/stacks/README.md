# Stacks
---

This directory contains subdirectories. Each subdirectory is a complete stack of resources, instead
of demonstrating a specific resource.

1. web-app1 - 2 EC2 instances with simple server running, and an Application Load Balancer between them
2. web-app2 - Builds on web-app1, and adds DNS, a Let's Encrypt certificate that is stored in Certificate Manager served by the Load Balancer.
