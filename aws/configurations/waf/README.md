# WAF
---

These configurations contain demonstrations of WAF.

In these confiurations, we create a S3 bucket with some content, and a 
CloudFront distribution which serves this S3 bucket.

In each configuration, we'll create a WAF web ACL with different configurations to 
demonstrate different capabilities and features.
